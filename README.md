# Crossfit_timer
Crossfit timer for Raspberry Pi and Adafruit 16 x 2 LCD screen in Python

The Adafruit LCD screen can be found here: http://www.adafruit.com/products/1110
I actually found a near-clone on Amazon for about $12 USD, that can be found here: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00SMHSTL0
They are the same, except on the "clone", the backlight color does not change, there is a diffused LED that changes colors instead.

Follow the install instructions for the Adafruit to get the libraries for the board and the Pi's I2C pins working as intended.


I started in IT when I was 11 years old, some coding, some hardware stuff, breaking and fixing all sorts of stuff. When I grew up, I joined the United States Marine Corps and really enjoyed a lot of the physical aspect of it.

I got rid of my smart phone about a year and a half ago and was looking for a Crossfit timer that would do the following:
  1) Run a stopwatch up
  2) Run a timer down
  3) Do both with intervals
  4) Run a Tabata timer
  5) Be pretty much self-contained
  6) Be able to run off of batteries (in case I am on the go, on vacation, etc.)

The wall timers exist out there are too big and not mobile. I can use a laptop and fitlb.com's timers every time I want to work out, but I just got a Pi and I want to see what it can do :)

This is very much a work in progress. I am building the modules one at a time, then I will add a menu, interrupts for pressing keys, etc. Pelase be patient, and get ahold of me if you have any questions.
